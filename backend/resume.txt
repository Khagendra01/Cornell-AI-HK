performance while supporting real-time sentiment analysis for multiple concurrent users.
• Engineered a real-time feedback system using WebSocket connections and Redis pub/sub, processing 10+ simultaneous mock interviews
with <12s latency.
• Implemented CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions to automate testing, deployment, and infrastructure provisioning, achieving
zero-downtime deployments and reducing release cycles by 60%.
Radical AI | AI Engineer Intern Jun 2024 - Aug 2024
• Led the development and deployment of AI solutions using OpenAI Assistant API and Google Gemini, employing agile methodologies to
achieve a 30% increase in system throughput.
• Managed end-to-end data pipeline processes, including data collection, cleaning, and preprocessing, to optimize data quality for generative
AI models, resulting in a 25% improvement in model performance and reliability.
• Spearheaded prompt engineering and performance testing, leveraging detailed analytics and AI testing to refine AI model interactions,
achieving 20% faster response times in user-facing applications.
Caldwell University | Machine Learning Researcher May 2024 - Aug 2024
• Architected and implemented a novel Xito Recurrent Unit to address the vanishing gradient problem in sequential data processing, resulting
in 17% improvement in computational efficiency compared to traditional architectures.
• Led a summer research project on neural network architecture design, addressing RNN challenges with diverse datasets and advanced
frameworks using PyTorch, which enhanced model accuracy and efficiency.
PROJECTS
Crystal Math
• Developed an AI-driven math problem-solving tool that transforms concepts into immersive animations, while implementing a 10x
cost-optimized video pipeline with Manim to maintain output and a seamless experience.
• Deployed a secure, scalable back-end using Flask and PythonAnywhere, ensuring reliable access to user-generated videos stored in AWS
S3, and enabling rapid retrieval and playback of solution animations.
• Streamlined payment and credit management functionalities through Verbwire, implementing usage tracking and pay-as-you-go scalability,
resulting in a sustainable, monetized user ecosystem.
E-Graveyard
